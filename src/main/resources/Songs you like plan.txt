We'll create a new python script tasked with picking a random song musicxml.
What it will do after picking a song is that it should find the longest part
of the song that has a max of 1 intervals each between the notes, as well
as shortest note, as well as max chord quantity. If the user's most difficult
learned clef is treble then it will omit the bass clef. If it's bass clef,
it will also still omit bass clef and if it's treble and bass clef, then
it should include the bass clef. Finally it should transpose that portion
of the song into the latest key signature that the user is learning. As usual
it should return a midi file and a sheet music image and be used to do the
same thing as in PianoExercise.java. Make it that Levels.java, after every 5
levels inserts a playtime level button in between. Then on level button click,
if the button text == "Playtime Level", pass PianoExercise.java a boolean
that says true, meaning that it should be a playtime level. Then set up
PianoExercise.java to use songsyoulike.py instead of generatemelody.py to
generate the melody, if the boolean for playtime is set to true. And you're
done. After every 5 levels now, the user is kept engaged by getting to play
songs they like. Make sure to write the name of the song that was picked as
well so that the user listens out for it and recognizes it, in case its a really
short portion of a song they like.
